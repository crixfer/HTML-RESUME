    <p>
      If there's something I really love doing in my leasure time, is
      <b>playing video games</b> . There's just something about the creativity
      and imagination put on them. It's an amazing world to enjoy every second
      of it all.

    <br />
    <p>
      Learning how to code had opened my mind in a way in which my critical
      thinking has increased considerably. Since I love challenge based
      learning, and this is constantly a challenge, I have managed to increase
      my way of perceiving things when approaching to them from the learing
      aspect. This is simply enlightning!

    <p>
      who doesn't like to listen to good music? I trully believe that there's no
      human being that hates music. Music is inspiring, is releaving, is
      therapeitic, is relaxing, It's a wonder of life. I'm constantly listening
      to music. Whether I'm working or not, my speakers are always sounding.
