    <h1>The Dominican Food has no Match!!!</h1>
    <h4>As you can read, the Dominican food rocks!</h4>
    <h5>...and here is why...</h5>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Mofongo</strong></li>
      <br />
      <span>
        This is by far one of the best Dominican dishes that you can try. It has
        many varieties, and it doesn't matter how or with what meat you order
        it, the garlic taste is heavenly delicious.

        Plantains are picked green, cut into pieces and typically fried but can
        be boiled or roasted, then mashed with salt, garlic, broth, and olive
        oil in a wooden pilón (mortar and pestle).
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <li><strong>Sancocho</strong></li>
      <br />

      <span>
        It is made with chicken and smoked ham (sancocho de gallina), top round
        beef (sancocho), pork feet with chickpeas (sancocho de patitas), beef
        short ribs with chorizo, or fish, shellfish and salted cod cooked in
        coconut milk and ginger with rice dumplings (caldo santo).

      <br />
      <br />
      <li><strong>La Bandera</strong></li>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        The most iconic of all. The Dominican Flag. The real combination for the
        real hungry.

      <span>
        Its namesake, La Bandera Dominicana food, is the Dominican national
        lunch meal. The red is represented by the beans, the white by the rice,
        and with a splash of poetic and culinary license here the meat usually
        chicken or beef represents the third color.

      <li><strong>Chen Chen</strong></li>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        The corn flavor in this one is a blast. It's an explosion of sweet and
        salt, fighting in your mouth to make you fall dreaming on it.
      </span>

      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        Depending on the cook's taste, it can be described as having a
        pilaf-like to risotto-like texture. Please do not confuse chenchén with
        chacá, a corn-based dessert, also from the same Dominican region.

      <br />
      <br />
      <li><strong>Mangu</strong></li>
      <br />
      <br />

        Did you say breakfast, lunch, dinner? Bring it on! This is good at any
        time, any day of the year. Done!

      <span>
        A creamy, smooth plantain mash, Dominican mangu is a great dish to start
        our days, and an unforgettable treat if you try it for the first time.
